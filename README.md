# XSS Testing Project

## Overview
This project is designed to identify and test for Cross-Site Scripting (XSS) vulnerabilities in web applications. It utilizes tools like Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP to perform automated scans and manual testing.

## Features
- Identification of Stored, Reflected, and DOM-Based XSS vulnerabilities.
- Use of popular tools for penetration testing.
- Detailed logging of vulnerabilities discovered during testing.

## Technologies Used
- **Kali Linux**: A Linux distribution used for penetration testing.
- **Burp Suite**: An integrated platform for performing security testing of web applications.
- **OWASP ZAP**: An open-source web application security scanner.

## Setup Instructions
1. Clone this repository:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/abhibarde001/XSS-Testing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project directory:
   ```bash
   cd XSS-Testing
   ```
3. Start the Apache server:
   ```bash
   sudo systemctl start apache2
   ```

## How to Use
1. Open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost/XSS-Testing`.
2. Use Burp Suite or OWASP ZAP to intercept and modify requests as needed.
3. Test for XSS vulnerabilities by injecting payloads into input fields.

## Testing
1. Launch Burp Suite:
   ```bash
   burpsuite
   ```
2. Set up your browser to use Burp as a proxy (HTTP Proxy: `127.0.0.1:8080`).
3. Conduct active scans and analyze the results.

## Results
- Document the vulnerabilities identified during testing.
- Include screenshots or logs from Burp Suite and OWASP ZAP.

## Mitigation Strategies
- Implement input validation and output encoding.
- Utilize Content Security Policy (CSP) to mitigate XSS risks.
